Here today i release a fairly simple dev script that creates items for ox_inventory and saves it to a config lua file, 
i have yet to integrate it to the items file within the inventory.

This is a dev tool and will eventually be integrated with the items.lua file within ox inventory so it saves automatically.

It is command based ( commnad to use is - oxadditem ) 
It utilizes the ox lib menu.
This can be used on either ESX or QB
It is nothing fancy and might not be of use to anyone but thought i would share it and hopefully i can integrate it to the items.lua within the next couple of days.

Dependencies: 
ox_lib


add to server file
